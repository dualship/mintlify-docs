description: Build APIs without writing code using JSON flow definitions
---

Dualship is a visual API builder platform. Users create fully functional backend APIs without writing code by defining **flows** - JSON documents that describe how an API should behave.

## Core Concept

Instead of writing code, you define APIs as flows. A flow is a JSON document that describes:

1. **Trigger** - How the API is invoked (HTTP request, cron schedule, webhook)
2. **Nodes** - What steps to execute in sequence
3. **Response** - What to return to the caller

These flows are stored as data and interpreted at runtime. When a request comes in, the executor processes the flow in real-time. No code generation. No deployment. The API is live the moment the flow is saved.

## How It Works

```json
{
  "name": "Create Payment",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "http",
    "config": {
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/payments"
    }
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "validate",
      "type": "request",
      "config": {
        "source": "request.body",
        "schema": {
          "amount": "required|numeric|min:1",
          "email": "required|email"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "process",
      "type": "http",
      "config": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "https://api.stripe.com/charges",
        "body": {
          "amount": "{{request.body.amount}}",
          "email": "{{request.body.email}}"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "respond",
      "type": "response",
      "config": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": {
          "success": true,
          "charge_id": "{{process.output.body.id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **12 Node Types** | Control flow, data manipulation, HTTP requests, and more |
| **Template Expressions** | Reference data with `{{path.to.value}}` syntax |
| **70+ Pipes** | Transform data inline with filters like `map`, `filter`, `sort` |
| **Parallel Execution** | Run multiple operations concurrently |
| **Error Handling** | Try-catch patterns for robust APIs |
| **Validation** | Built-in request validation with 50+ rules |

## Node Categories

Nodes are organized into categories:

**Control Flow**
- `condition` - If/else branching
- `switch` - Multi-way branching
- `parallel` - Concurrent execution
- `loop` - Iteration over arrays or counts
- `try` - Error handling with catch/finally

**Data Manipulation**
- `set` - Store values in context
- `transform` - Reshape and compute data

**HTTP/Network**
- `http` - Make outbound HTTP requests

**Response/Abort**
- `response` - Send HTTP response
- `abort` - Stop flow with error

**Timing**
- `delay` - Pause execution

**Validation**
- `request` - Validate incoming data
