## Frequently Asked Questions

### What counts as an execution?

An execution is counted each time a flow runs, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. For HTTP-triggered flows, each incoming request counts as one execution.

### What happens if I exceed my execution limit?

Your flows will continue to work. We will notify you when you approach your limit and recommend upgrading to a higher plan.

### Can I change plans at any time?

Yes. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, changes take effect immediately. When downgrading, changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

### What are triggers?

Triggers define how a flow is invoked. See the [Triggers by Plan](#triggers-by-plan) section above for availability. The Free plan includes HTTP and manual triggers. Upgrade to Hobby or Pro for advanced triggers like cron scheduling and [queue processing](/triggers/queue).

### How do team seats work?

Each plan includes a number of seats (users who can access your workspace). The Free and Hobby plans include 1 seat. The Pro plan includes 5 seats, with additional seats available for $15/month each.
